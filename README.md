Project 2 final


**Scientific question**: what is the molecular basis of naturally developed human CCR5 mutation in HIV resistance?

**Hypothesis**: if a mutation occurs on CCR5 that can influence the conformational integrity or structure of this molecule, which results in impaired CCR5 expression at cell surface or binding to gp120 expressed by HIV, then the cell carrying this mutation will be resistant to HIV infection.


**6met_CD4_gp120_CCR5.pdb**: pdb file containing the structure of complex formed by gp120 expressed by HIV and CD4 and CCR5 expressed by the target cell, the formation of this complex is required for HIV entering the target cell.

**C101A.pdb**: pdb file containing the structure of human CCR5 with point mutation of Cystine at amino acid position 101 to Alanine obtained through homology modeling using SWISS-MODEL.

**C101A.txt**: text file containing the protein sequence of human CCR5 with point mutation of Cystine at amino acid position 101 to Alanine used for homology modeling.

**C20S.pdb**: pdb file containing the structure of human CCR5 with point mutation of Cystine at amino acid position 20 to Serine obtained through homology modeling using SWISS-MODEL.

**C20S.txt**: text file containing the protein sequence of human CCR5 with point mutation of Cystine at amino acid position 20 to Serine used for homology modeling.

**CCR5.fasta**: fasta file containing the protein sequence of wild-type human CCR5.

**CCR5.pdb**: pdb file containing the structure of wild-type human CCR5 obtained from pdb file 6met_CD4_gp120_CXCR5.pdb.

**CCR5_delta_32.fasta**: fasta file containing the protein sequence of human CCR5 with mutation of 32 basepair deletion in the coding region used for homology modeling.

**delta_32.pdb**: pdb file containing the structure of human CCR5 with mutation of 32 basepair deletion in the coding region obtained through homology modeling using SWISS-MODEL.

**CCR_alignment.fasta**: multiple sequence alignment file of beta-chemokine receptors, including CCR1, CCR2b, CCR3-2, CCR4, CCR5, CCR6, CCR7, and CCR8, in fasta format obtained using MAFFT online server

**CCR_seq.txt**: text file containing protein sequences of beta-chemokine receptors ment to use for multiple sequence alignment

**CD4_gp120_CCR5.png**: image generated with each protein (CD4, gp120, CCR5) of the complex labeled with different color using PyMol

**Project 2 final.html**: the final version of project 2 knitted into html file from Jupyter notebook.

**Project 2 final.ipynb**: the final version of project 2 downloaded as ipynb file from Jupyter notebook.
